This project explains how to set up a secure and dependable cloud storage system using AWS (amazon web services) simple storage services (s3). Cloud storage plays a major role in how people and organizations handle data today because it allows files to be stored, organized and accessed from anywhere. Through this task, the goal was to understand how to create an S3 bucket, upload different types of files, manage permissions, and generate URLs for accessing the uploaded objects. To complete this task, I used AWS S3 as the main storage service. it is one the most reliable object storage services vailable, known for its durability and scalability. it allows you to tore files as objects inside buckets, which work like folder and each object can have its own metadata and access settings. This structure makes it easier to control security at both the bucket level and file level. S3 also integrates well with other AWS services, which is why it is commonly used for hosting static websites, storing backups, managing user uploads and handling large data sets. --For development and file management, i used Visual studio(VS code). It is a  lightweight editor thats support a variety of extensions. In this task, I installed the AWS Toolkit for VS code, which made it possible to connect directly to my awss account and work with S3 from within the editor. This saved time since i didn't have to switvh between the AWS console to the local environment. The toolkit allowed me to view my S3 buckets, upload and download files, and quickly check object URLs. -- The AWS command line interface(CLI) was also used in this project. The CLI is helpful when you need to perform tasks quickly or repeat the same action multiple times. I used  the AWS CLI to connect my local system to my AWS account by configuring my access key and secret access key. After setting it up, i could run AWS command from the terminal to manage my S3 bucket, upload files, and generate pre-signed URLs without needing to log in to the AWS console.

steps performed:--
1) Logged into the AWS Management console.
2) created a new S3 bucket and selected Mumbai ragion close to my location to reduce latency.
3) Adjusted bucket settings and public access options.
4) uploaded imahes and documents to the bucket.
5) ser permissions for selected objects.
6) Generated object URLs from VS code and the AWS console.
7) Created pre-signedURLs using the AWS CLI.
8) Checked file access in a browser.

This kind cloud storage setup is used in many real-world situations:-
1) Web applications: websites use S3 to storen images, document.
2) Backup and disaster recovery : companies store logs, database backups and system snapshots in S3.
3) Internal file sharing within an organization: teams share file through public or pre-signed URLs.
4) CDN integration: S3 works with CloudFront to deliver content globally.
5) Static website hosting : HTML, CSS and JavaScript sites can be hosted directly on S3.
6) Big data workflow : S3 is commonly used as astorage layer for tools like Glue, Anthena and EMR.

CONCLUSION 

Through this task, I learned how to create and configure S3 bucket, upload and manage files, set permissions and generate URLs. I also gained hands-on experience with VS code, AWS toolkit and AWS CLI. These  skills are valuable for cloud computing, devops and application development roles.
